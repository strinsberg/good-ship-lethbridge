<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This is a simple text based adventure game Following are instructions for compilation and then some sections of the user manual that will help get you going. For full game info and even a walk through please see the user manual in docs/user/userManual.pdf</p>
<h1>Compilation</h1>
<p>To run the game clone the repository at the command line do ``` $ make adventureGame $./adventureGame ``` This will build the game and then allow you to run it in your terminal</p>
<h1>How to play</h1>
<p>Here we have provided you with an explanation of all the actions the player can take and the game commands that are available to you. Followed by a more thorough explanation of how to enter you actions and commands. We finish with a few hints on what kind of information you are likely to encounter when interacting with the game world, and what it might mean.</p>
<p>All actions can be typed with any case you want. Also, except for load, you can just use the first letter of the desired action instead of typing the whole action. This is most helpful with long action names like inventory.</p>
<h3><a class="el" href="class_game.html" title="Object responsible for running the game. ">Game</a> Actions</h3>
<p>The actions available to the player are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a class="el" href="class_get.html" title="Action to obtain a game object. ">Get</a> Moves an item from the room you are in into your inventory. The item can be in the room or nested inside a container in the room and you will be able to take it. eg) &gt; get box</li>
<li><a class="el" href="class_drop.html" title="Action to remove an item from the players inventory and place it in the player&#39;s current room...">Drop</a> Removes an item from your inventory and places it in the room. eg) &gt; drop box</li>
<li><a class="el" href="class_use.html" title="Action to use a game object. ">Use</a> Attempts to use an object in the world. If an object is usable you will interact it. eg) &gt; use common room door</li>
<li><a class="el" href="class_talk.html" title="Action to talk to an NPC. ">Talk</a> Interact with an NPC. Can work in 2 ways.<ul>
<li>Brings up a talk menu. Select the number of the option you would like. After making a choice the dialogue will pop back up so you can make another choice without having to retype the command. Enter the number for Cancel to exit the dialogue.</li>
<li>The NPC will respond in some way. This may be to say something to you or give you an item, etc. You should not be shy to talk to them again as sometimes they will have more to say, or to do. eg) &gt; talk Clem spanner</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a class="el" href="class_look.html" title="Action to inspect a game object. ">Look</a> Gives you information about the room you are in or a specific object in that room. eg) &gt; look → gives room information eg) &gt; look box → gives info about the box and what is in it.</li>
<li><a class="el" href="class_inventory.html" title="Action to view players inventory. ">Inventory</a> Lists the items in the players inventory. eg) &gt; inventory</li>
</ol>
<h3><a class="el" href="class_game.html" title="Object responsible for running the game. ">Game</a> Commands</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><a class="el" href="class_help.html" title="Command to get help. ">Help</a> Lists some information on the available player actions and game commands. eg) &gt; help</li>
<li><a class="el" href="class_save.html" title="Command to save the game. ">Save</a> Saves the current state of the game. Creates a file using the player's name or overwrites an existing file. <b>NOTE</b> if you want to try a different approach, but keep previous progress use a new name. eg) &gt; save</li>
<li><a class="el" href="class_load.html" title="Command to load a saved game. ">Load</a> Allows you to load previous progress. Like save this works using the players name. So you must start a game with the name of the player you wish to restore progress for.</li>
<li><a class="el" href="class_quit.html" title="Command to quit the game. ">Quit</a> Exits the game. <b>NOTE</b> this action is immediate and all unsaved progress will be lost.</li>
</ol>
<p>Entering commands</p>
<p>The parser for this game is extremely simple. All commands are read as a verb followed by a noun. This means not all commands will be intuitive to type, and all text after the command or action will be interpreted as the target of that action or command. For example:</p>
<p>``` </p>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>action target</p>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>``` <b>action</b> → one of the actions listed above <b>target</b> → the name of the object to apply action to</p>
<p>Typing in actions that don't exist will be met with a message telling you you can't do that. And if you spell a targets name wrong or try to act on something not in the room or your inventory you will be told there isn't one.</p>
<h3>Some messages</h3>
<p>``` You can't verb! ``` You have entered an action that is not available. Check your spelling or the help menu and try again. ``` For some reason you can't ``` This means that you are trying to use an object that is not active yet. There is usually a way to activate it. eg) a lock for a door. If your find yourself stuck in a room with doors that give this message when you try to use them look for other actions to take. ``` You don't have what you need ``` This means that you are trying to do something that requires you to have a specific item in your inventory. Like the above message it may result in the activation of something or in new actions. <a class="el" href="class_look.html" title="Action to inspect a game object. ">Look</a> around for objects you think might be useful and try again (remember the object might be in another room).</p>
<p>There will be other messages you encounter.</p>
<h1>Tips</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>Items can be active or inactive. <a class="el" href="class_look.html" title="Action to inspect a game object. ">Look</a> for ways to activate them. They may not always let you know when you have done the right thing Some items are not obtainable. If you are told you can't get something that means you can't ever get it. You don't need to keep trying</li>
<li><a class="el" href="class_interaction.html" title="An event to interact with the player. ">Interaction</a> with NPC is not always the same. Try different things. You never know if an NPC might have more to say or be more responsive if you have something they want in your inventory.</li>
<li>There is no limit to how much you can carry</li>
<li>Our apologies, but due to the limited parser you must type full names of any object you wish to interact with. This can get a little cumbersome at times and a little misspelling can ruin the attempt. NOTE any extra spaces will also result in failure.</li>
<li>You do not have to worry about lower and upper case. All input will be fixed so that it can be compared easily. So don't worry about capitalizing names and such. Type it how you want to. If it is spelled correctly it will work.</li>
<li>All actions except for <a class="el" href="class_load.html" title="Command to load a saved game. ">Load</a> can be entered with just the first letter of the action. eg) get or g will work to get something. </li>
</ol>
